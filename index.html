          One player chooses an X as their symbol and the other player will have
          Os as theirs. Click in the square where you want to add your symbol
          and it will appear.
        </p>
        <p>
          For keyboard navigation, press the "s" key to enable it. Then use the
          arrow keys to highlight the square you want, then press the
          Enter/Return key to add your symbol in that square.
        </p>

          The first player to get 3 X's or O's in a row (across, down or
          diagonally) wins!
